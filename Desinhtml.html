        Once there lived a very clever fox in jungle. One day, when the fox was walking through the jungle and the fox fell into a trap. He landed on his tail. When the fox came out, he left his tail behind. Without tail the fox looked very strange and the fox felt very sad and ashamed. But the fox was very cunning.
The fox thought and thought and finally hit upon a plan. The fox called all other foxes of the jungle in a meeting. When all other foxes attended the meeting, the fox told them that he had made an important discovery. The fox said that there was no use of their tails. It was a burden.
So the fox told them to cut off their tails. Many foxes supported his plan. They said that he was right. At that moment one old wise fox became angry and said in anger, “Don’t follow this rogue. He has lost his tail in a trap. Now, he looks strange. He want to look you like him”. Hearing this the all foxes became very angry with the cunning fox. The cunning fox fled away in fear and saved his life. As you sow, so shall you reap it’s true.

    There lived an honest wood-cutter in a village. His village was beside a jungle. He used to cut wood from the jungle, sell in the nearby market and bear his family expenses. He was not rich but passed his life with great happiness. One day, he was cutting wood near a pond in the jungle. At once his axe fell into the pond. The pond was very deep. The wood-cutter became very sad. He was at a loss what to do. Finding no other way, he prayed to God for help.
Then a strange incident occurred. A beautiful fairy came out of the water and asked him why he was not cutting wood. The wood-cutter described the incident in details. The fairy dived into the water and brought a silver axe. She asked him if it was his axe. The wood-cutter saw the axe and said, “No.” Then the fairy showed him another axe made of gold and asked, “Is this the axe that you lost?”
The wood-cutter said, “No. The fairy showed him the lost axe with a wooden handle. The wood-cutter then said happily that it was exactly his axe. Seeing the honesty of the wood-cutter the fairy became very pleased and gave him both the gold and the silver axes along with his old iron axe. Then, the wood-cutter became rich and began to live happily. It was the reward of his

    My friend : In front of my reading room.
    Myself    : How do you pursue your hobby.
    My friend : I plant the seedlings and take care of them regularly. I water them and weed them regularly. I grow flowers and vegetables in my garden. Vegetables are very useful for our health and the flowers are very beautiful. When the flowers bloom, the garden looks very beautiful. The flowers charm and amuse me with their sweet scent and beauty.
    Myself    : I think your hobby is very interesting.

    Myself    : My hobby is to play cricket with my friends. In every afternoon I play with my friends. And I keep my body fit by playing cricket. And my mind also remains sound as it lives in a sound body.

    My dear father,
    
    
    
    I hope you and mother are doing well and everything is fine at home. I am all good here and working hard for my annual examination. Father! As you know that my annual examination is coming soon, my teachers suggested me two important books to improve my score. So I will be grateful if you could sent me Rs. 500/- for buying these books. I promise you that I will score good marks at examination.
    Please pay my respect and love to my dear mother.
    
    
    
    My Dear Nafiz,
    Please accept my heartfelt affection. By Almighty Allah’s mercy, I hope you are doing well. I am also fine. You inquired about our college’s prize-giving event in your last letter. I’m now composing a brief summary of it. 
    The annual prize-giving event for our college’s academic results and athletics was held yesterday, March 13th. The event was exciting and enthralling. It was held on the grounds of our college. The authorities concerned decked the college grounds with colorful flags and falcons to commemorate the occasion.
    The ceremony began with the Holy Quran being recited. The minister of youth and sports was invited as the event’s chief guest. For excellent outcomes in the Test Examination and two games, I received three rewards. Many pupils were also awarded prizes. Following the prize-giving ceremony, the drama ‘As You Like It’ by William Shakespeare was staged. We had a great time.
